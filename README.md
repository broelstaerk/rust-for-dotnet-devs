# Learning Rust links

This is a collection of links to resources I used to learn Rust

* [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) The go to getting started tutorial
* [Exercism Rust Track](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust) a great place to start doing some Rust code
* [No Boilerplates Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/NoBoilerplate/videos) very well put together videos explaining "Why Rust"
* [No Boilerplates Rust Videos collection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJTDTyNdJdY&list=PLZaoyhMXgBzozt1LeHkCv8ERUPxhXT1eE) collection of videos that are great for beginners (these where not created when I learned Rust, but I wish they where).
* [Learn Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/learn/) if you like game development I would suggest trying out Bevy
* [Embeded Rust Book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/) if you want to use Rust for embeded, this is a good place to start
* [The Rustacean Station Podcast](https://rustacean-station.org/) A great Rust focused podcast that talks to developers of different Rust products
* [Rust for Rustaceans](https://nostarch.com/rust-rustaceans) Once you have the basics down, this is a great way to dive deeper
* [Crust of Rust](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqbS7AVVErFiWDOAVrPt7aYmnuuOLYvOa) deep dive videos into different Rust subjects
